modifications or updates may be significant, including the adoption of
new versions of the Network Content that differ substantially from the
current version and result in significant changes to the Network. Such
changes may include updates or the implementation of a more advanced
version of the Network’s consensus algorithm, fee model, smart contract
capabilities, security, governance and operation model or other features
of the Network.

Such updates or modifications may be proposed by the Subject Persons,
Guardians or other persons or entities who desire to make such
proposals. The acceptance of such proposals may be subject to approval
in accordance with the terms of the Network’s then-applicable security,
governance and operation model. Alternatively, in the case of certain
upgrades to the security, governance and operation model or changes that
otherwise supersede or are not technically implementable within the
Network’s then-applicable security, governance and operation model, the
acceptance of such changes may depend on the practical decision by
Guardians, Token Holders, Developers and End-Users to implement such
proposals or adopt the version of the Network containing such proposals
or to decline to do so.

## 5.  **Governance, Voting and Procedures of the Network**

As a decentralized network, the actual existence and performance of the
Network is dependent on the collective actions of various participants
in the Network, including, among others, Guardians and Token Holders.
The Network may not continue to exist and may not perform as expected if
such parties cease their activities on the Network. No one, including
the Subject Persons, can guarantee that such parties will continue to
act or that the Network will continue exist or perform at the expected
level.

You hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that the Network is governed
by defined voting governance guidelines, as such may be in effect and
amended from time to time in accordance with the then-applicable
governance framework of the Network.

If you are a Guardian, you hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that
your activities on the Network are subject to the Guardian statement set
forth in <u>Exhibit A</u> hereto, that you will comply with the
provisions of such statement in all respects in your activities on the
Network and that failure to comply with such provisions may result in
penalties in accordance with the then-applicable governance provisions
of the Network.

Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that:
(i) only Token Holders who are beneficial owners of Orbs Tokens are
permitted to vote or delegate such Orbs Tokens in the course of any
governance or decision-making procedure to which such Orbs Tokens have
participation rights; (ii) any person holding any Orbs Tokens in the
capacity of custodian on behalf of a Token Holder who is not the
beneficial owner of such Orbs Tokens shall not have the right to vote,
delegate or otherwise participate in the governance of the Network, and
shall not take any such action unless expressly instructed to do so by
the Token Holder who is the beneficial owner of such Orbs Tokens; (iii)
no user shall offer nor accept anything of value in exchange for a vote
of any type, except in accordance with any reward system of the Network
that may be in effect from time to time, nor shall any user unduly
influence the vote of another.

The Network has been designed to provide service cost stability to users
and developers by setting the prices of the computing resources required
for each type of on-demand service available on the Orbs networks at a
certain number of Orbs tokens, which prices have been set forth on the
Orbs Operation Fees document at https://www.orbs.com/pricing/. The
specific prices listed therein are presented in good faith and believed
to be correct at the time of publication, however the model presented
may be changed from time to time during the launch period, including as
the result of ongoing testing of the model and actual results before and
during the launch period.

The pricing list for computing services on the Orbs network may be
subject to change from time to time, including, without limitation, by
replacing such prices with prices based on an index of prices published
by third party cloud providers or by other methods of pegging
transaction costs on the Orbs network to a dedicated amount of computing
capacity.

Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing, changes to the
specific prices listed on the price list may occur at any time during or
after the launch period as a result of adjustments to the pricing model
based on the outcome of testing, adjustments to the pricing model based
on actual results during the launch period, additional experience in the
behavior of the market for dedicated capacity, changes to the
information available from third party cloud service providers, changes
due to unforeseen cost increases or decreased of cloud computing, and
changes initiated by participants in the governance of the Orbs network.

## 6.  **Prohibited Conduct**

You warrant and agree that, while accessing or using the Network, you
will not:

-   access, use or attempt to access or use another user’s account,

    Network Content;

## 7.  **Purchases**

You acknowledge that entering into any transaction electronically
(including without limitation all records relating to such transactions)
constitutes your agreement and intent to be bound by and to pay for such
agreements and transactions. Such transactions may, among other things,
include payments between participants for their activities on the
network, transaction fees paid by Developers to Guardians for providing
computing resources on the network, arrangements between Guardians and
Token Holders with respect to staking, voting and rewards within the
Network’s security, governance and operation mode and arrangements with
respect to fees paid by End Users to Developers. Notwithstanding that
such transactions and other similar transactions may be allowed,
facilitated or encouraged by the design of the Network and components
included in the Network Content, you acknowledge and agree that the
actual entry into any such agreement, transaction or arrangement by any
users of the Network is accomplished as a peer-to-peer transaction
between the parties thereto and is subject to the terms of the agreement
between such parties. You are solely responsible for any disputes you
may have with any Network participant or any other party regarding such
agreements and transactions. THE SUBJECT PERSONS DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY
RELATED TO ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN, BY AND AMONG YOU AND ANY DEVELOPERS,
END-USERS, GUARDIANS AND/OR TOKEN HOLDERS.

## 8.  **Objectionable Content**

You may find some Network Content, Developer Content and/or End-User
Content offensive or objectionable. You agree that your use of the
Network, including access to such Network Content, Developer Content
and/or End-User Content, is at your sole risk, and that the Subject
Persons shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to
be offensive or objectionable. Descriptions of Network Content,
Developer Content and End-User Content available on the Network are for
your convenience.

## 9.  **Links to Third-Party Websites**

The Network may include links to websites of third parties. If you click
on these links, you will leave the Network. Network participants are not
responsible for their content or operation. You should exercise your own
judgment in evaluating and using these websites. When you link to these
websites, you become subject to their terms and conditions of use and
privacy policies.

## 10.  **Notifications concerning Blockchain Technology and Virtual Currency**

The Network is based on blockchain technology. Furthermore, the Network
requires the use of a virtual currency, the Orbs Tokens, for certain
aspects of its functionality. Without limitation, the Orbs Tokens are
required for Developers to pay transaction fees to Guardians for
providing the services needed to run their applications on the Network.
In addition, participants in the Network’s security, governance and
operations model, including Guardians and Token Holders, may utilize the
Orbs Tokens in order to participate in the model by direct voting or
delegating the vote associated with such Orbs Tokens, and may receive
rewards in the form of Orbs Tokens for such activities, all in
accordance with the then-applicable security governance and operations
model.

Accordingly, when using this Network, you should be aware of the
following risks associated with virtual currency, including the Orbs
Tokens, and blockchain-based software, including the Network:

-   virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the
    government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor
    Protection Corporation protections or similar laws in any
    jurisdiction;

-   legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal,
    or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer,
    exchange, and value of virtual currency;

-   transactions in virtual currency are generally irreversible, and,
    accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions
    may not be recoverable;

-   some virtual currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when
    recorded on a “block chain” ledger, which is not necessarily the
    date or time that the customer initiates the transaction;

-   the value of virtual currency is derived from the continued
    willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for
    virtual currency, which may result in the potential for permanent
    and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should
    the market for that virtual currency disappear;

-   there is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency
    as payment today will continue to do so in the future;

-   the volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency
    relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss or tax
    liability over a short period of time;

-   the nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of
    fraud or cyber-attack;

-   the nature of virtual currency means that any technological
    difficulties experienced by You may prevent the access or use of a
    customer’s virtual currency;

-   the Network is likely to experience scheduled and unscheduled
    downtime, interruptions, delays, hard forks, bugs, viruses, and
    cyberattacks;

-   the Network may from time to time lack features or functionality
    and/or require maintenance, support or other adjustments;

-   the Network rests or relies on open-source software, and there is a
    risk that a person introduces weaknesses, bugs, viruses or other
    malicious code into the core infrastructural elements of the
    Network causing the system to lose or erase all or a portion of
    the Orbs Tokens used in connection with the Network;

-   it is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number
    of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and
    that there will be limited public interest in the creation and
    development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest
    could impact the development of the Network and potential uses of
    Orbs Tokens. It is not possible to predict the success of any
    development efforts of any party;

-   the actual existence and performance of the Network is dependent on
    the collective actions of various participants in the Network,
    including, among others, Guardians and Token Holders. It is possible
    that the Network may not continue to exist and may not perform as
    expected if such parties cease their activities on the Network. No
    one, including the Subject Persons, can guarantee that such parties
    will continue to act or that the Network will continue exist or
    perform at the expected level;

-   you recognize that the Network is under development and may undergo
    significant changes over time and you acknowledge that any
    expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Network
    held by you may not be met upon release of the Network or any
    update thereto, for any number of reasons including a change in
    the design and implementation plans and execution of the
    implementation of the Network;

-   the state of cryptocurrency can advance over time and advances in
    code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of
    quantum computers, could present risks to the Orbs Tokens and the
    Network, which could result in the theft or loss of Orbs Tokens.
    To the extent possible, participants in the Network may attempt to
    update the protocol underlying the Network to account for any
    advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security
    measures, but the future of cryptography cannot be predicted and
    there can be no guarantee that any security updates will be made
    in a timely or successful manner;

-   as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Network
    is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to
    double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks,
    “Selfish-mining” attacks or race condition attacks and any
    successful attacks present a risk to the Network, expected proper
    execution and sequencing of transactions in Orbs Tokens, and
    expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.
    Despite the efforts of participants in the Network, including
    Guardians, known or novel mining attacks may be successful.

-   if the Network is rapidly adopted, the demand for Orbs Tokens could
    rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which
    new Orbs Tokens are released from reserves or otherwise become
    available for use. Under such a scenario, the entire Network could
    become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running
    distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in
    the Network and Orbs Tokens. Instability in the demand for Orbs
    Tokens may lead to a negative change of the economical parameters
    of an Orbs Token-based business which could result in the business
    being unable to continue to operate economically or to cease
    operation.

-   if the Network is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction
    processing and distributed application computations could rise
    dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which
    Guardians can bring online additional computing power. Under such
    a scenario, the entire Network could become destabilized, due to
    the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn,
    this could dampen interest in the Network and the Orbs Tokens.
    Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in
    the price of Orbs Tokens could result in businesses being unable
    to acquire scarce computational resources to run their
    applications.

-   It is possible that alternative which utilize the same open-source
    source code and open source protocol underlying the Network could
    be established. The Network may compete with these alternative
    networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Network
    and the Orbs Tokens; and

-   the Network could be impacted in whole or in part by one or more
    regulatory or governmental inquiries or actions, which could
    impede, limit or restrict the use or transfer of Orbs Tokens or
    otherwise result in the complete or partial loss in value of Orbs
    Tokens.

You hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) you are accepting
and using the Network and the Orbs tokens at your sole risk and expense;
(ii) you have an adequate understanding of the risks, usage and
intricacies of cryptographic tokens such as the Orbs tokens and
blockchain-based software such as the Network, including the risks set
forth above; (iii) any and all Subject Persons shall have no
responsibility or liability for the loss, transfer, misappropriation,
theft, use or misuse of any Orbs Tokens, including as utilized in
connection with the Network, or any financial or physical harm or loss
related thereto, and you hereby irrevocably waive any and all rights and
claims with respect thereto and claims with respect thereto, (iv) you
will comply with any and all applicable rules and laws regarding your
use of Orbs Tokens, including in connection with the Network and (vi)
the Subject Persons not endorse or recommend the use of any software or
hardware wallet services and/or market exchanges (including any
over-the-counter market) in connection with any storage, transfer or
other transaction related to Orbs Tokens, all of which may be used at
your sole risk and expense.

## 11.  **Representations and Warranties and Warranty Disclaimers**

The Network is a peer-to-peer platform with a decentralized,
blockchain-based architecture designed to provide blockchain
infrastructure-as-a-service. As a decentralized platform, the actual
existence and performance of the Network is dependent on the collective
actions of various participants in the Network, including Guardians and

# Exhibit A
 
## Declaration of Guardians

In registering to become eligible to serve as a Guardian and operate a
validator node on the Orbs Network, I \[we\] hereby declare to all other
participants in the Orbs Network, that for so long as I serve as a
Guardian I \[we\] will be committed to the security, governance and
operation procedures of the Orbs network.

-   <u>Model</u>. I am familiar with the roles of different agents
    active in the Orbs network –Guardians and Delegators – as described
    at https://www.orbs.com/orbs-pos-universe/ (the “<u>Model</u>”)
    and the responsibilities of each role and the procedures connected
    with each role. I accept the principles of the Model and intend to
    cooperate with the other participants in the Orbs Network in
    accordance with the Model.

-   <u>Protocol and the Terms of Use</u>. I am \[we are\] familiar with
    the protocol specifications contained in the GitHub repository
    located at https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go as may be
    in effect from time to time (the “**Orbs Protocol**”). I \[we\]
    intend to operate an Orbs Guardian node to ensure that the rules of
    the Orbs Protocol are followed with respect to all transactions on
    the Orbs network. I \[we\] further agree to comply with the Orbs
    Network Terms of Use located at
    https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/blob/master/NETWORK-TOU.md,
    as may be in effect from time to time, in all respects.

-   <u>Participation</u>: I \[we\] will participate in the Orbs Protocol
    for each virtual chain then operating on the Orbs Network by
    proposing blocks and confirming them according to the Orbs Protocol
    as then in effect.

-   <u>Computational Resources</u>. I \[we\] will dedicate the required
    amount of computational resources to operate such virtual chains.

-   <u>Virtual Chains</u>. I \[we\] will assist in the creation of
    virtual chains to support fee-paying applications interested in
    running on Orbs.

-   <u>Non-Discrimination</u>. I \[we\] will enforce the rules of the
    Orbs Protocol equally to all users, domains and transactions. My
    \[our\] validation services shall not discriminate between
    transactions or blocks based on any parameter that is not relevant
    to the operation of each virtual chain or for any reason that is
    extraneous to the Orbs Protocol.

-   <u>Uptime/Liveness</u>. I \[we\] will ensure that my \[our\]
    Guardian node will be available 99.9% of the time, provided that I
    \[we\] shall be permitted to have planned downtime of up to 5 hours
    per month. To the best of my \[our\] abilities, planned maintenance
    will be coordinated with other Guardians to minimize the impact of
    such downtime.

-   <u>Connectivity</u>. I \[we\] will provision resources to ensure
    proper bandwidth and low latency of connectivity with other nodes
    and will maintain the required communication routes, ports and
    endpoints.

-   <u>Upgrade Process</u>. I \[we\] will participate in the protocol
    upgrade process by diligently reviewing all proposed upgrades and
    confirming or rejecting such upgrades according to the best
    interests of the Orbs Network and all participants therein.

-   <u>Updated Protocol</u>. I  \[we\] will run software that complies
    with the most recent version of the Orbs Protocol, as accepted under
    the then-applicable governance procedures of the Orbs Network.

-   <u>Security Upgrades</u>. I \[we\] will address all critical and
    security upgrades in an immediate fashion, providing the necessary
    resources to ensure the security of the Orbs Network.

-   <u>Security Best Practices</u>.  I am \[we are\] aware of the
    security implications of operating a Guardian node on the Orbs
    Network, including physical security, private keys and credentials
    storage and use cloud services security, server, operating system
    and application hardening and intend to act in a manner consistent
    with industry best practices to ensure the secure operation of the
    Guardian node.

-   <u>Rewards</u>. I am \[we are\] familiar with the terms of the Orbs
    Universe Reward Plan as may be in effect from time to time (the
    “<u>Reward Plan</u>”) and accept and am \[are\] willing to
    participate and be eligible for the Guardian rewards as set forth in
    the Plan in accordance with the terms thereof.

-   <u>Terms</u>: I \[we\] acknowledge and agree that all use of, access
    to and activities on the Network are subject to the Orbs Network
    Terms of Use, as may be in effect from time to time.

-   <u>Liability</u>. I \[we\] acknowledge and agree to the limitations
    of the liability of any and all entities and persons who created
    and/or initially distributed Orbs Tokens or were otherwise involved
    in the creation of the Orbs Network that are set forth in the Orbs
    Network Terms of use. I \[we\] acknowledge and agree the terms of
    liability set forth in the Orbs Network Terms of Use.

-   <u>Non-Derogation</u>. I will not take any malicious action, whether
    on the Network or outside of it and will not disparage the Orbs
    Network or the other parties participating in the Orbs Network in
    good faith.
